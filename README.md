# KDE Service Menus

KDE service menus I wrote for my personal use.

## Installation

Clone the repo and copy the plugins with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/
cp *.desktop ~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/
```

Other methods:

- Download them from KDE Store [(links below)](#plugins).
- On Dolphin, look for them under "Download New Services".

## Dependencies

Check the dependencies in each pluginâ€™s header or in the links below.

## Plugins

Each plugin adds a context menu item to Dolphin.

- [Add to VLC playlist](https://store.kde.org/p/1192990/)

- [Enqueue on Celluloid](https://store.kde.org/p/1346072/)

- Deprecated: [Copy path](https://store.kde.org/p/1190998/) - This functionality was eventually integrated into Dolphin ([commit](https://github.com/KDE/dolphin/commit/86e3b82efbbcdb287773cdaf6a5f4c1c22bb9fc6)).
